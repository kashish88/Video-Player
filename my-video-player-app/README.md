Project Structure:
App.js: The main component where the VideoPlayer and Playlist components are rendered.
components/VideoPlayer.js: Contains the VideoPlayer component responsible for playing videos with controls like play/pause, volume control, playback rate, fullscreen mode, etc.
components/Playlist.js: Contains the Playlist component responsible for displaying a list of videos, allowing searching, and reordering.
media.js: Contains JSON data with video information.
styled-components: Styled components are used for styling throughout the application.

Additional Notes:
The application uses React hooks extensively for state management.
Styled-components library is used for styling, allowing CSS to be written directly within JavaScript components.
The VideoPlayer component utilizes the ReactPlayer library for video playback.
Drag and drop functionality is implemented in the Playlist component for reordering videos.
The playlist can be searched through with a search input.
Autoplay functionality is included in the VideoPlayer component, which plays the video automatically.
The application is responsive, with different layouts for smaller and larger screens.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
